| `PHENO <https://brapi.biodata.pt/>`_ is a database dedicated to store phenotypic metadata.
| If you're looking for a comprehensive guide of both **PHENO** and the **OntoBrAPI** platform, then you've come to the right place.

.. admonition:: In a Nutshell, **PHENO**:

   1. Receives as input a Miappe compliant Excel file
   2. Validates it according to the MIAPPE specifications
   3. Makes your metadata and associated phenotypic data FAIRly available worldwide through BrAPI compatible search engines

Make your data FAIR using PHENO
-------------------------------

| **FAIR** data is increasingly more valued in research, with new projects tending to follow **FAIR** guidelines when working with their data.
| **PHENO** aims to increase data FAIRness by making plant phenotypic data searchable and readily accessible by specialized databases, such as `FAIDARE <https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/faidare/>`_.
| This is achieved by making your data compatible with the **Breeding API (BrAPI)**.

Getting Started
---------------

| To submit metadata in **PHENO**, users are required beforehand to deposit the actual phenotypic data (e.g., tables, images) in another data holder of choice, for example:

1. Dataverse* (preferred)
2. Google Drive
3. Microsoft OneDrive
4. Other alternative/specialized data repositories

| \*Dataverse is a specialized database for agnostic scientific data. For portuguese users, learn here on :ref:`how to submit your data in DMPortal<dataverse>`, the portuguese instance of Dataverse.

| To use PHENO for the first time, please check the :ref:`Getting started with PHENO <start>` section.
| To get acquainted with the FAIR and MIAPPE standards, or terms such as **BrAPI** or **FAIDARE**, feel free to check the :ref:`References <references>` section.

PHENO Database Structure
------------------------

| **PHENO** integrates 3 main functions based on international standards:

1. Data submission (MIAPPE)
2. Data storage (RDF)
3. Data sharing (BrAPI)
