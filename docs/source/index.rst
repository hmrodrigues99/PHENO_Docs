| **OntoBrAPI** is a Webtool that serves as entry point for **MIAPPE** compliant data into **BrAPI** compatible databases.
| If you're looking for a comprehensive guide of the **OntoBrAPI** platform, then you've come to the right place.

.. admonition:: In a Nutshell, OntoBrAPI:

   1. Receives as input a Miappe compliant Excel file
   2. Validates it according to the Miappe specifications
   3. Makes your metadata and associated data available through various BrAPI compatible search engines

Make your data FAIR using OntoBrAPI
-----------------------------------

| **FAIR** data is increasingly more valued in research, with new projects tending to follow **FAIR** guidelines when working with their data.
| **OntoBrAPI** aims to increase data FAIRness by making it searchable and readily accessible by specialized databases, such as `FAIDARE <https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/faidare/>`_.
| This is achieved by making your data compatible with the **Breeding API (BrAPI)**.
