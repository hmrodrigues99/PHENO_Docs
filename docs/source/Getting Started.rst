Getting started with PHENO
==========================

| **PHENO** is a database dedicated to store phenotypic metadata.
|
| It can be used as a search engine to check and access phenotypic data and metadata.
| By submitting in PHENO, your metadata will be safely secured, and your data will be more FAIR and accessible through the Breeding API. 

Searching and Retrieving Data
-----------------------------

| Users can search for specific datasets in PHENO through the search bar, using keywords such as:

1. Species name
2. Project name
3. People involved in the project

| After finding the desired dataset, users can download its metadata and/or have direct access to the data itself, if public, through a link to its specified repository.

Submitting Data in PHENO
------------------------

| Submitting data in PHENO is done using **OntoBrAPI**. Check the dedicated OntoBrAPI section here.
