Getting started with PHENO
==========================

| `PHENO <https://brapi.biodata.pt/>`_ is a data portal for the submission, storage and sharing of metadata for plant phenotypic experiments.
| It can be used as a search engine to look for plant phenotypic data, and store your experiment metadata to comply with FAIR guidelines.
| By submitting in PHENO, your project metadata will be secured, and your data will be more `FAIR <https://fair-software.eu/about>`_.

Submitting Data in PHENO
------------------------

| Submitting data in **PHENO** is done using the `OntoBrAPI <https://brapi.biodata.pt/submit>`_ tool.
