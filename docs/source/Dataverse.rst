   * Uploading your data with HTTP via your browser

.. note::
   Optionally, you can also add your filled MIAPPE template in the Files section.

.. note::
   Multiple datasets can be added to the same Dataverse to accomodate for all your phenotypic data.

| 11. Finally, go to your Dataverse page and click on **Publish** to make your data public.
|     A pop-up will appear to confirm the action, since once a dataverse is made public, it can no longer be unpublished.

| Please consult the `Dataverse User Guide <https://guides.dataverse.org/en/4.20/user/>`_ for additional information on how to use the platform.
| With your data now stored in Dataverse, you can proceed with the :ref:`Submitting Metadata in PHENO <ontobrapi>` section.
