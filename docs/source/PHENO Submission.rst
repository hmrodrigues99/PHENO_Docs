Submitting Metadata in PHENO
============================

| This example based section will showcase how to submit your **MIAPPE** compliant Excel file in **PHENO** using **OntoBrAPI**.
| If you don't have this file ready, start by following the :ref:`Fill a MIAPPE Template<dataverse>` tutorial.
|
| Each of the following examples will showcase possible outcomes when trying to submit your file using **OntoBrAPI**.

Example 1 - Valid File
----------------------

| In the first example, the user has a simple **MIAPPE** compliant excel file:

| üìÅ `OntoBrAPI Example File 1 (Valid) <https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/ontobrapi-web/raw/master/public/assets/Miappe_compliant_Excel.xlsx>`_

To submit your metadata:

1. Open **PHENO**
2. Click **Submit Data**. This will take you to the **OntoBrAPIPP submission platform
3. Click **Input file** and select your file of choice (e.g., ``Miappe_compliant_Excel.xlsx``)

| A preliminary validation report will appear in the top right corner.
| After a sucessfull validation check, the following prompt will appear:

.. figure:: /images/OntoBrapi_validationsucess.png
   :scale: 26%

| Alongside the Mapping Section and a preview of the uploaded file:

.. figure:: /images/OntoBrapi_uploadsucess.png
   :scale: 50%

4. After upload, we need to do the mapping. For this, click **Load Mapping**

| This will open a list of Predefined Mapping Templates.

4. Select the ``standard_mapping.json`` option

| Since our input file is a standard MIAPPE file, this will automaticaly conclude the mapping.
| The mapping success is seen on the color and number in the file sheet names, like shown bellow:

.. figure:: /images/OntoBrapi_uploadsucess.png
   :scale: 50%

5. Lastly, click **Run**
   
| That's it! Your metadata was sucessfuly submitted in PHENO.
| The phenotypic data associated with your now submitted metadata is now readily accessible in databases using BrAPI, such as the case of `FAIDARE <https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/faidare/>`_.

Example 2 - Invalid File
------------------------

| The second example will showcase working with an invalid input file:

| üìÅ `OntoBrAPI Example File 2 (Invalid) <https://github.com/forestbiotech-lab/ontobrapi-web/raw/master/public/assets/Miappe_INCOMPLIANT_Excel.xlsx>`_

| Let's try and submit this file and try to identify and fix eventual errors during submission.

1. Click Input File and select the ``Miappe_INCOMPLIANT_Excel.xlsx``

As we can see, the loading failed due to an input file validation error.

.. figure:: /images/OntoBrapi_validationsucess.png
   :scale: 26%

| By clicking in the *FAILED* button within the validation report menu, a drop-down of messages indicate a "CHECK FAILED - Invalid Input File Sheet Names" entry.
| This means that one or more sheets in the Excel file are missing or have different names from the ones described in the MIAPPE standards.
| Let's take a closer look to the invalid file sheet names:

.. figure:: /images/OntoBrapi_invalidsheets.png
   :scale: 50%

* The Person sheet name is not in English. Fix ‚Üí "Pessoa" to **Person**.
* The Data file sheet name is incomplete. Fix ‚Üí "Data" to **Data file**.
* | In addition, the Environment sheet is missing. FIX ‚Üí create a new sheet called **Environment**,
  | and write **Study unique ID\***, **Environment parameter\*** and **Environment parameter value\*** in the first row

.. figure:: /images/OntoBrapi_fixedsheets.png
   :scale: 26%

| After fixing these problems, retry file submission:

2. Click Input File and select the fixed *``Miappe_INCOMPLIANT_Excel.xlsx``*

| Once again, upload fails. By looking at the validation report, we see a "CHECK FAILED - Invalid Investigation Sheet Names".
| In this case, by looking at the file, we see that the first two column headers within the Investigation sheet are incorrect.

* FIX ‚Üí The column name "Investigation ID" should be **Investigation unique ID\***
* FIX ‚Üí The column name "investigation title" should be **Investigation title\***.

.. note::

   If you use the provided MIAPPE template, errors of this nature will be prevented.

| For this last example, we will supply a valid Excel file, but use an incorrect mapping file (Invalid_Mapping_example.json).

Example 3 - Invalid Mapping
---------------------------

1. Click Input File and select the *Miappe_compliant_Excel_file.xlsx*
2. Click the **Load Mapping** option, and select the - *Invalid_Mapping_example.json*
3. Press Submit

As we can check by the warning, the supplied mapping was insufficient to properly connect the supplied Miappe metadata.
